# auto-unzip-transmission
auto unzips media files that have been zipped after the download has been completed. 
my config for transmissions has been edited but also posted in settings.json if you need an example config. I highly recommend setting up an nginx reverse proxy for the http server to have it serve https.

I will also post my nginx config in this repo as well.
